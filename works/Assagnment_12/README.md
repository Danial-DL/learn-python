This is a data analysis code from Iran Khodro cars. 🚙🚗
# Note : Make sure you are running the code in the Colab, the csv file is in the same directory, and the Colab settings are set to GPU mode.🚨⛔
## This code takes all the data from the csv file and analyzes it thoroughly, plots each chart based on correct statistics and comparisons with each other, and also displays the data values, their number and type, etc. in a completely beautiful-looking html page.✔️✅
