# Simple Linear Regression from Scratch: Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project implements a basic **Simple Linear Regression** model using the **Gradient Descent** optimization algorithm from scratch. It utilizes the **Boston Housing Dataset** to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (`medv`) based on the average number of rooms per dwelling (`rm`).

## 🚀 Getting Started
